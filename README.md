A phylogenetic tree or evolutionary tree is a branching diagram or "tree" showing the evolutionary relationships among various biological species or other entities. We used Darwin’s idea of “descent with modification.” Basically, by looking at the pattern of modifications (novel traits) in present-day organisms, we can figure out—or at least, make hypotheses about—their path of descent from a common ancestor.
